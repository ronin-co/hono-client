A [Hono middleware](https://hono.dev/guides/middleware) for querying data from [RONIN](https://ronin.co) with ease.

## Setup

First, install the [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ronin/hono) with a package manager of your choice:

```bash
# Bun
bun add @ronin/hono

# npm
npm install @ronin/hono
```

Next, create a new app token on the [RONIN dashboard](http://ronin.co) (under "Apps" in the sidebar), and add it as a environment variable named `RONIN_TOKEN` to your Hono context.

Once added, you can import and use the middleware in your Hono app:

```typescript
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { ronin } from "@ronin/hono";

const app = new Hono();

app.use("*", ronin());

app.get("/", async (c) => {
  const posts = await c.var.ronin.get.posts();
  return c.json(posts);
});
```

That's it! ðŸŽ‰

You can now start inserting records with the [RONIN query syntax](https://ronin.co/docs/queries), or add them on the [RONIN dashboard](http://ronin.co). Everything you can do with the RONIN Hono middleware, you can also do on the dashboard (creating records, retrieving them, filtering them, updating them, etc).

### TypeScript

Out of the box, we also export the required `Bindings` and `Variables` types, which you can use to extend the Hono context and get full auto-completion:

```ts
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { ronin, type Bindings, type Variables } from "@ronin/hono";

const app = new Hono<{
  Bindings: Bindings;
  Variables: Variables;
}>();

app.use("*", ronin());
```

## Contributing

We would be excited to welcome your suggestions for the RONIN Hono middleware!

To start contributing code, first make sure you have [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed, which is a JavaScript runtime.

Next, [clone the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and install its dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Once that's done, link the package to make it available to all of your local projects:

```bash
bun link
```

Inside your project, you can then run the following command, which is similar to `bun add @ronin/hono` or `npm install @ronin/hono`, except that it doesn't install `@ronin/hono` from npm, but instead uses your local clone of the package:

```bash
bun link @ronin/hono
```

If your project is not yet compatible with [Bun](https://bun.sh), feel free to replace all of the occurances of the word `bun` in the commands above with `npm` instead.

You will just need to make sure that, once you [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request#creating-the-pull-request) on the current repo, it will not contain a `package-lock.json` file, which is usually generated by npm. Instead, we're using the `bun.lockb` file for this purpose (locking sub dependencies to a certain version).

### Developing

In order to be compatible with a wide range of projects, the source code of the `hono-client` repo needs to be compiled (transpiled) whenever you make changes to it. To automate this, you can keep this command running in your terminal:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Whenever you make a change to the source code, it will then automatically be transpiled again.

### Running Tests

The RONIN Hono middleware has 100% test coverage, which means that every single line of code is tested automatically, to ensure that any change to the source code doesn't cause a regression.

Before you create a pull request on the `hono-client` repo, it is therefore advised to run those tests in order to ensure everything works as expected:

```bash
# Run all tests
bun test

# Alternatively, run a single test
bun test -t 'your test name'
```
